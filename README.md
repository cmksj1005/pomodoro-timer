# Pomodoro Timer

The purpose of this project is to create a personalized Pomodoro timer to effectively track and manage net study time. Recognizing the importance of structured study sessions and breaks for maintaining productivity and focus, this timer provides a customizable and engaging way to adhere to the Pomodoro Technique. By developing this timer independently, it ensures that the tool is tailored to specific study habits and preferences, enhancing the overall efficiency and consistency of study sessions.

## Features

The Pomodoro timer boasts several key features designed to optimize study sessions. Upon clicking the start button, the main message changes to "Study," initiating a 25-minute countdown. After completing this period, the timer displays a "Short Break" message, signaling a brief respite. Every four study sessions, users are rewarded with a longer 15-minute break to recharge. Additionally, the timer visually tracks progress by displaying small dots for each completed study session, allowing users to easily monitor their cumulative study time. This intuitive and motivating interface ensures a balanced approach to studying and breaks, promoting sustained productivity.
