# Pomodoro Timer

The purpose of this project is to create a personalized Pomodoro timer to effectively track and manage net study time. Recognizing the importance of structured study sessions and breaks for maintaining productivity and focus, this timer provides a customizable and engaging way to adhere to the Pomodoro Technique. By developing this timer independently, it ensures that the tool is tailored to specific study habits and preferences, enhancing the overall efficiency and consistency of study sessions.
